# pwshmatt-vscode-theme

Thank you for checking out my dark VS code theme designed primarily for PowerShell development. This theme targets a handful of PowerShell
theme tokens that are unused by other VS code themes.

This is my first attempt at creating my own VS code theme so I fully expect this extension will evolve over time as I begin to use it my
day-to-day coding work.
